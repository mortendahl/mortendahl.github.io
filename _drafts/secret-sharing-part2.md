## Fast Fourier Transform

Indeed, our current implementation of the packed scheme relies on the Fast Fourier Transform over finite fields (also known as a Number Theoretic Transform), whereas the typical implementation of Shamir’s scheme only needs a simple evaluation of polynomials.

```python
# len(aX) must be a power of 2
def fft2_forward(aX, omega=OMEGA2):
    if len(aX) == 1:
        return aX

    # split A(x) into B(x) and C(x) -- A(x) = B(x^2) + x C(x^2) -- and recurse
    bX = aX[0::2]
    cX = aX[1::2]
    B = fft2_forward(bX, (omega**2) % Q)
    C = fft2_forward(cX, (omega**2) % Q)
        
    # combine subresults
    A = [0] * len(aX)
    Nhalf = len(aX) // 2
    for i in range(Nhalf):
        x = (omega**i * C[i]) % Q
        A[i]         = (B[i] + x) % Q
        A[i + Nhalf] = (B[i] - x) % Q
    return A

def fft2_backward(A):
    N_inv = inverse(len(A))
    return [ (a * N_inv) % Q for a in fft2_forward(A, inverse(OMEGA2)) ]
```

```python
# len(aX) must be a power of 3
def fft3_forward(aX, omega=OMEGA3):
    if len(aX) == 1:
        return aX

    # split A(x) into B(x), C(x), and D(x): A(x) = B(x^3) + x C(x^3) + x^2 D(x^3)
    bX = aX[0::3]
    cX = aX[1::3]
    dX = aX[2::3]
    
    # apply recursively
    omega_cubed = (omega**3) % Q
    B = fft3_forward(bX, omega_cubed)
    C = fft3_forward(cX, omega_cubed)
    D = fft3_forward(dX, omega_cubed)
        
    # combine subresults
    A = [0] * len(aX)
    Nthird = len(aX) // 3
    for i in range(Nthird):
        
        j = i
        x = (omega**j) % Q
        xx = (x * x) % Q
        A[j] = (B[i] + x * C[i] + xx * D[i]) % Q
        
        j = i + Nthird
        x = (omega**j) % Q
        xx = (x * x) % Q
        A[j] = (B[i] + x * C[i] + xx * D[i]) % Q
        
        j = i + Nthird + Nthird
        x = (omega**j) % Q
        xx = (x * x) % Q
        A[j] = (B[i] + x * C[i] + xx * D[i]) % Q

    return A

def fft3_backward(A):
    N_inv = inverse(len(A))
    return [ (a * N_inv) % Q for a in fft3_forward(A, inverse(OMEGA3)) ]
```

## Conclusion
Although an old and simple primitive, secret sharing has several properties that makes it interesting as a way of delegating trust and computation to e.g. a community of users, even if the devices of these users are somewhat inefficient and unreliable.

Implementing in Rust also turned out to have many benefits, not least due to the strong guarantees its type system provides, its highly efficient binaries, and its ease of cross-compilation.

The source code for the library is now available on GitHub, including examples and performance benchmarks.

<em><strong>TL;DR:</strong> The one-time pad is perhaps considered a toy encryption scheme that has strong secrecy guarantees but no-one in their right mind would use in practice. However, modern cryptography makes several references to it in various forms and knowing why and where it works helps understand many widely-used schemes and protocols.</em>

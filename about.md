With a background in cryptography and privacy, Morten has spent recent years applying and adapting techniques from these fields to machine learning, focusing on practical tools and concrete applications with the aim of making privacy-preserving machine learning more accessible to practitioners.

His work has primarily been on encrypted deep learning and secure federated learning. This includes [TF Encrypted](https://github.com/tf-encrypted/tf-encrypted), an open source project for encrypted deep learning in TensorFlow, and [SDA](https://github.com/snipsco/sda), an open source project for secure federated learning on sporadic devices.

Morten holds a MSc in theoretical computer science and a PhD in cryptography. He currently works as a research scientist at [Dropout Labs](https://dropoutlabs.com/), a startup focused on taking privacy-preserving machine learning to production. Previously, he lead the cryptography team at [Snips](https://snips.ai/), a startup focused on building private-by-design machine learning systems for mobile and embedded devices. He is an early member of [OpenMined](https://www.openmined.org/), an online community building a platform for secure federated learning.
